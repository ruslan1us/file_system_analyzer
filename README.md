# File System Analyzer

## Overview
A Python-based command-line tool for analyzing file system structure and usage on Linux systems.

## Features
- Recursive directory traversal
- File type categorization
- Size analysis by file type
- Large file identification
- Unusual file permission detection

## Prerequisites
- `Python 3.7+`
- `python-magic` library
- `unittest` (included in Python standard library)
- `Pillow` library

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python main.py /path/to/directory [-t THRESHOLD]
```

### Options
- `directory`: Path to the directory you want to analyze (required)
- `-t, --threshold`: Large file size threshold in MB (default: 100)

### Example
```bash
python main.py /home/user/documents -t 50
```

## Running Tests
To ensure the correctness of the functionality, this repository includes a set of unit tests. These tests verify the core features of the File System Analyzer, including:

1. **Directory Traversal**: Ensures that the analyzer correctly traverses directories and processes files.
2. **File Type Categorization**: Verifies that files are correctly categorized based on their types
3. **Large File Detection**: Tests the detection of files that exceed a specified size threshold.
4. **Unusual Permissions Detection**: Checks if the analyzer identifies files with world-writable permissions or unusual access rights.
5. **Report Generation**: Ensures that the report generated by the analyzer includes the expected information.
6. **Error Handling**: Verifies that the analyzer handles cases such as inaccessible directories correctly.

To run the tests, use the following command:
```
python -m unittest tests.py
```

This will execute all the tests defined in the tests.py file. The tests will automatically clean up the test environment (e.g., removing temporary files and directories) after they complete.

## Limitations
- Requires read permissions for traversed directories
- May take longer on large file systems
- Symbolic links are skipped to prevent infinite loops
